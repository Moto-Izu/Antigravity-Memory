# ✈️ Antigravity Flight Log: 2025-12-29

## 🎯 Daily Mission
- [x] Research AI Leaders' 2025/2026 Vision & NotebookLM Video Gen
- [x] Initialize YOROZU Mission Control & Flight Log System

## 📝 Activity Log
| Time | Action | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 14:01 | **System Start** | Verified YOROZU Environment |
| 14:15 | **Research** | Gathered 2025/2026 visions from OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA, Anthropic |
| 14:30 | **Artifact Gen** | Created `ai_vision_2025_2026_source.md` (OMNI Synthesis included) |
| 14:45 | **NotebookLM** | Uploaded source via Agentic Browser; Ready for Audio Gen |
| 15:00 | **YOROZU Init** | Established Git-based memory sync system |

## 🧠 Key Decisions & Insights
- **Agentic Browser Strategy:** Using the browser agent to operate NotebookLM is the optimal "omni-compatible" method until an official API is released.
- **Flight Log Protocol:** Daily logs in `logs/` directory will serve as the "shared memory" across Antigravity instances.
